Welcome to the Non-Elective Flow Simulation App (v0.0). The app and
underlying model are being developed by the Data & Analytics team
at the Countess of Chester Hospital. This app is designed to help understand 
the effect of different management strategies on ED admission delays (DTA waits)
. Please note that development of this tool is at an early stage and treat 
results with caution. We welcome any feedback on the tool.

##### Example questions the model can provide evidence for:
* Given x beds, how far does admitted length of stay have to reduce to meet 
particular waiting time targets for those queuing in ED? (Evidence based target)
* If we open 15 beds but keep admitted length of stay the same, what is the 
impact on ED waiting times and the various targets? (Evidence for a particular 
management strategy)
* What is the optimum number of people to stream from ED to SDEC to minimise ED
waits for admission? (Evidence for a particular management strategy)
